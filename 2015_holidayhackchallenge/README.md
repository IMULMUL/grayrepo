# Holiday Hack Challenge 2015 By SANS

Challenge site @ https://holidayhackchallenge.com/

This is a very interesting set of challenges created by SANS for the Christmas 2015 period.

It consists of 5 main levels and are designed to be completed one level at a time. Although participants can skip the order at any time, it is encouraged to do it in order.

By doing it in order, an interesting story is revealed :)

- [L1 CuriousPackets](L1_CuriousPackets)
- [L2 FirmwareAnalysis](L2_FirmwareAnalysis)
- [L3 ScavengerHunt](L3_ScavengerHunt)

- [L4-2 GnomagePwnage_SG02](L4_Pwn_SG02)

I particularly enjoyed the [L4-5 GnomagePwnage_SG05](L4_Pwn_SG05) challenge. It is quite an interesting Binary Exploitation challenge. Take a look if that is your kind of thing.

I managed to get a "Super Honorable Mention" from SANS ( no t-shirt thou :( ). My many thanks to those who were involved for a very well put together challenge.

The following is my official submission for the contest. It includes some additional storytelling (Read till the end :D)
