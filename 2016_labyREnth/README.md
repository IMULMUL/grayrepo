# LabyREnth CTF By Palo Alto

Challenge site @ http://labyrenth.com/

This was a month long reverse engineering centric CTF created by Palo Alto

It consists of 6 different tiers (Windows, Unix, Mobile, Docs, Random, Threat). Each tier has a set of challenges where you have to clear each stage to proceed to the next.

Do note all challenge zip files provided are password protected (pw is "infected")

I've managed to complete the Windows, Mobile and Docs tier. Therefore, I will be uploading writeups for all the challenges in these 3 tiers. Writeups for other tiers may also be uploaded if I have time to write them :)
