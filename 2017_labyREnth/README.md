# LabyREnth 2017 CTF By Palo Alto

Challenge site @ http://labyrenth.com/

This was an approximately 6 weeks long reverse engineering centric CTF created by Palo Alto

It consists of 5 main tiers (Binary, Mobile, Docs, Threat, Programming).  
Each tier has a set of 5 challenges where you have to clear each stage to proceed to the next.  
After completing all 5 tiers, there is also a boss challenge.  
It also has a Random tier which are hidden all over the challenge map

Do note all challenge zip files provided are password protected
- Default pw is "labyrenth" unless otherwise stated

I've managed to complete 1 random challenge, the 5 main tiers and the Boss challenge. Therefore, I will be uploading writeups for these challenges.
